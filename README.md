Current
-------

* clean_up_google_music - Lets the user choose what types of items Google Music displays in the default pane - albums, playlists, suggested albums, user-defined instant mixes/radio stations, and/or auto-suggested instant mixes/radio stations. Also makes every item a uniform, smaller size.
* show_saved_searches - Shows the saved searches as a card in the main G+ stream

In a holding pattern
--------------------

* hide_posts - Adds a close button to each card to hide posts from the user without forcefully muting them. With the new G+ layout (summer 2013) which added two- and three-column layouts, I'm unsure if this is still as useful as when every post was displayed in one column.

Obsolete
--------

* no_maximize - G+ now fully hides the maximize button by default
* show_all_pages - G+ no longer includes a popup listing the your pages
